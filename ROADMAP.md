# Roadmap for Developing AI Tool to Analyze GitHub Issues Based on Criteria

## 1. **Define Criteria and Similar Words** ✅ 
   - Gather a comprehensive list of criteria for evaluating software components (e.g., "Accomplishment").
   - Collect a list of similar words or synonyms for each criterion using word2vec or any other semantic vector-based method.

## 2. **GitHub Data Extraction** ✅ 
   - **Task**: Extract issues from GitHub using the GitHub API.
   - Use libraries like **PyGithub** (Python) to fetch issues, pull requests, comments, and labels from a specific project repository.
   - Store the extracted data in a structured format (JSON or CSV).

## 3. **Data Preprocessing and Embedding**
   - **Text Preprocessing**:
     - Tokenize, lemmatize, and remove stop words from the GitHub issue texts (titles, bodies, comments).
     - Use libraries like **spaCy** or **NLTK** for text processing.
   - **Text Embedding**:
     - Convert the issues into embeddings using pre-trained models such as **Sentence Transformers** (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) or **OpenAI embeddings**.
     - Embed the predefined criteria and their similar words to generate vector representations for each criterion.

## 4. **Match Issues to Criteria**
   - **Task**: Use similarity measurement to map GitHub issues to predefined criteria.
   - Compute cosine similarity between the issue embeddings and criterion embeddings to determine the relevance of an issue to a given criterion.
   - Threshold similarity scores to decide whether an issue is highly relevant to a particular criterion.

## 5. **Summarize Issues**
   - **Task**: Generate concise summaries of issues related to specific criteria.
   - Use language models like **GPT-4** (via OpenAI API or Azure OpenAI) to summarize the GitHub issue content, focusing on key concerns related to the criteria.
   - Format output in an actionable format (e.g., issue summary and suggested actions).

## 6. **Generate Insights and Reports**
   - **Task**: Provide a structured report on each criterion based on the analysis.
   - Create a report format that highlights the current concerns for each criterion, such as:
     ```
     Criterion: Accomplishment
     Current Situation: Issues related to professionalism due to unclear documentation, and fatigue from excessive refactoring.
     Recommended Actions: Improve documentation practices, review refactoring frequency.
     ```
   - Visualize the data for better clarity.

## 7. **Implement Reporting Dashboard (Optional)**
   - **Task**: Build a dashboard to present the analysis results.
   - Use frontend frameworks like **React** or **Streamlit** for building the UI.
   - Display reports, criteria health over time, and current issues for each project.

## 8. **Automate Data Fetching and Monitoring**
   - **Task**: Set up automated processes for fetching new GitHub issues at regular intervals (daily/weekly).
   - Automatically update the summaries and analysis as new issues are reported.
   - Implement alerting when certain criteria exceed a threshold (e.g., fatigue-related issues exceeding a certain number).

## 9. **Backend Setup**
   - Use **FastAPI** (Python) or **Flask** to build RESTful APIs for serving the application.
   - Integrate with GitHub API to fetch issues, and integrate with OpenAI or local NLP models for embeddings and summarization.
   - Store data in a database like **MongoDB**, **SQLite**, or **PostgreSQL** for scalability.

## 10. **Deploy the Application**
   - **Task**: Host the application for use by developers and project managers.
   - Use cloud platforms like **AWS**, **Azure**, or **Heroku** to deploy the app.
   - Ensure that the API endpoints are secured and scalable for handling multiple projects.

## 11. **Ongoing Maintenance and Enhancements**
   - Monitor the performance and accuracy of the tool.
   - Continuously update the embeddings model with new data, fine-tune it if necessary, and keep the GitHub API access up-to-date.
   - Incorporate user feedback and improve the summarization and reporting logic as the tool is used in real-world scenarios.
